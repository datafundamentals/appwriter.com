# Flipping the script

Flipping the script means agency - for coders, anyway. We're here to stay.

## 2025: AI turns coders into a _science experiment_

Cool. I'm a lab rat, now. Who would have known?

Let's see where this goes. Experiment becomes the experimenter!

Sure, there are layoffs. We've got a little bit of time on our hands. Wonder what's gonna happen with that?

## Back on Top?

Coders have always had a maximum degree of agency in the corporate world. Maybe that's over? Maybe we are left out in the cold?

Or, maybe it's not. Maybe we're still on top? Maybe the dust hasn't settled yet?

Here's what we know. For decades, we've been setting the pace in organizations across the globe. We make things happen, the rest of the organization helps split up the revenues. So maybe we're not needed any more, AI can replace us.

Or, maybe we've got the time and resources to run some experiments of our own?

## Fit

We meet a couple times a week, mostly just to work/learn from each other, ratchet up our skills, share the portfolio, test out ideas.

If you think you might be a good fit, send me a note. We're a small [group?], and we like it that way.

Mon Wed 7pm CST. Some are yawners, some pop your eyes open. Depends on who shows up, & with what.

This field is moving fast right now, so there's always a ton of stuff to compare notes about.
