# Membership

Access to the PEG Community and The Portfolio Electives Game itself is limited to serious professionals with paid membership.

Pay is either in money or a negotiated trade (such as software). You are also expected to bring something intangible to the community, see below.

## Ante

App number one in your portfolio is on you, and is required before membership. For everything else in your PEG-scored portfolio, we can provide (or not) a boltup starter app to make things easier for you to host the electives.

## Assumed App Skills

Please do not join this community if you are not at least minimally skilled as a full stack developer. Basics are sufficient, such as you might obtain by completion of a coding bootcamp.

There are free bootcamps which can also get you up to this level, which is perfectly adequate. You are expected to show a minimal running full stack app which you have built, in order to join this community.

## Community, first.

The payment of $1000 is intentionally pricey and is primarily intended to limit the community to those people who have a significant stake in both their outcome, and also the outcome of others in the community.

What we offer can and should be achieved for free or for less, by anyone who desires it. The resources we provide might get you where you want to go faster and in better style, but you can still get there without us.

## Pro Status - Our Definition

This community is generally limited to persons who have worked in a domain for a few years and know what it means to be held to professional expectations.

Pro doesn't mean white collar, in this context. Any domain of skilled work can fit, construction trades being one example. What divides us is comfort(?) with living up to professional expectations for years at a time without that being a big deal.

## Includes

- Portfolio Electives Game
- Boltup projects to provide very rapid portfolio starter kits with strong resources.
- Access to the very meager but still valuable 35+ Electives definition resources.
- Twice Weekly Checkins at a posted times.

## Refunds and Regrets

No refunds are offered. This is for serious professionals only, if $1000 is too much to burn, please don't.

## Intangibles

This is a community of serious professionals. As a condition of acceptance, you are required to bring an intangible to the community. For most, this will be their status as a professional. For others, this will be a negotiated value.

## Community Success and IP

Our success as a community depends, to a modest degree, on protection of our internal IP.

You are expected to help us maintain our IP as a condition of membership.
