# Why a BaaS, or Back end as a Service

We're going to cover a wide number of issues here, and they overlap! Please try to keep them separate in your brain - they can get very confusing if one is just trying to get a coding Portfolio built.


1. Wait, what about just a plain SQL database?
2. Authentication, Storage, Serverless, many more! Oh my!
3. SQL and NoSQL db options.
4. Different providers, different pricing and offerings.
5. Common security across options.
6. Cloud provider, beyond the BaaS
7. It doesn't make sense for this to all be free
8. Why local emulator so critical?
9. Why not free open source alternatives?

## TL;DR

The shortest version of this story is easier.

_**"I want to give my portfolio the best resources I can! And I don't have time to mess with a back end, so better if well documented and pre-tooled."**_

10 years ago this would have been a pipe dream. Today there are lots of great options, and Firebase is one of, if not the best.

dF assumes that little or none of this is familiar, so we do some setup for you, assuming you'll start from there.

If you need the rest of the principles around a BaaS for your portfolio, read on.

## Wait, what about just a plain SQL database?

If you learned that an app needs a database, and not much more - you are a normal developer.

Only some of us have had the chance to expect and consume such a wide array of services beyond a single SQL database, on the back end.

## Authentication, Storage, Serverless, many more! Oh my!
 
There is a very wide array of .... such as binary file storage and serverless - and this array of services is sometimes in the dozens!

Since dozens more features than a SQL database would be too much to cover here, let's not cover them. Instead just understand that your electives portfolio might benefit from some of them, so having them available in a single free or almost free access point would be a good place to start.
## SQL and NoSQL db options.
## Different providers, different pricing and offerings.
## Common security across options.
## Cloud provider, beyond the BaaS
## It doesn't make sense for this to all be free




what are the elective supported features that need a BaaS?
which ones to only run on local emulator???
