# First Day Setups

When you're playing PEG, each new app platform should be [done on the first day.](anchor)

If it takes longer than that, you're not playing PEG, you're building a skillset that the market probably doesn't care about anyway.

## What an App Setup is

One of these, which you will be _turning into one of your own PEG **Portfolio Apps**_:

- Boltup Java Spring
- Boltup Lit SPA
- Boltup React
- Boltup 11ty SSG PWA

What does Setup mean, in this context?:

- Fully deployed and operational hello world app with no electives installed.
- Complete connectivity with a production quality Baas Back end as a Service: Firebase
- Secured with Authentication by others.
- Completable using electives chosen by PEG player, and appropriate for specific Boltup Starter App chosen.

## What an App Setup is not

An app setup is not about the electives that form the basis of the market's interest in your skills.

## Done On The First Day

Per [app setup](anchor) above, your app is ready to start playing PEG against. 

## Before the First App

- set up your BaaS and Authentication
- this should also be a First Day completion

## Example

- You've already done several apps with various electives.
- Now you want to add a 5th app, this one would be a spring boot app for adding a reactive cassandra web service
- You start with your running
