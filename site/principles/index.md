# Rules and Principles

- This game is not expected to remain static. The market is always ratcheting up, so should we.
- The point of the game is not to get points relative to other players, but to use the points to ratchet up your job prospects
- Boltups are provided to allow you to focus on electives, not the gameboard
- Two players with the same points should always be unequal in both effort and capability
- Points are always self awarded and can always be cheated.
- Graphics design does not carry points but will often get you farther than points will, in the market

## Principles:

- inevitable obsolescence, 2035, 2045
- SMEs, not coders
- turd polishing and dead careers
- generic vs concrete
- leader vs one of the
- standard vs revolutionary
- also see /appwriter2035
- 

## Chains vs Project

- electives can be a project
- more likely they are part of a chain of stacks on a single project
- 

## 5 / 25 checklist

Here's our top 5 goals, and [why we try to avoid any other goals](/principles/five_twentyfive/)

- decoupled first day boltups
- full power baas
- farm out login registration
- first day on anything other than electives skill demo
- game
