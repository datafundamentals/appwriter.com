# Our Version of 5/25

[The 5/25 rule is noted here](https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/warren-buffetts-brilliant-25/5-rule-was-fake-heres-what-he-really-said-about-achieving-success.html) or about 50 more places on the web ...

Here are our priorities, if we filter with the 5/25 rule

## do (max 5):

- decoupled boltups
- full power baas
- farm out login registration
- first day on anything other than electives skill demo
- game

## avoid (rest of the top 25):

- argue about stacks
- perfection on just about anything other than the 5 do meeting basic objectives - (AKA turd polishing)
- marketing - 2035 SMEs are enough, we prefer a smaller community
- any security greater than ["Portfolio Grade"](/principles/portfoli_grade_security)
