# Serialization Types:

Complex data on the back end has to be "serialized" or converted into some type of textual format before it can be passed between different systems. 

## The Most Commonly Used

The most common ways to serialize data before passing it between systems are, for example

- json
- delimited
- text
- xml

## High Speed Serialization Types:

These are not normally dealt with but can be used between extreme high speed, high volume systems when more compact, and/or faster serialization is required.

These might be super interesting, but might be rare within the context of a job interview.
