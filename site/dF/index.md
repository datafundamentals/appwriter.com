# dF

A playing board, not the game:

If PEG is a game for proving your skills with electives, then dF is the equivalent of a playing board.

If PEG was _painting_, then dF is a _canvas_ to paint on. And so the analogies go.

## Why dF?

Portfolio Electives Game is about _**Electives**_ - because your abilities with electives is what potential employers care about most. Not your ability to build apps from scratch - your prospective employer's engineers already do that.

With dF, you focus your time on maximizing electives, not the base app.

## "But I also need to show I can build an app!"

You've already created an app from scratch, as a condition of PEG fit.

Please see [this](/fit) if there is any question about your qualification requirements.

## Not 1, but 10 or more apps!

PEG is designed to show your skills in multiple settings, with lots of flexibility and eye candy to wow visitors. Quick dF Apps allow you to do that, because you're not emphasizing the hosting app, but the electives contained within.

One app? How about 5, or 10, or easily more, dependent on your imagination?

What prevents success with a 10 app portfolio showing off skills with 20 or more electives?
