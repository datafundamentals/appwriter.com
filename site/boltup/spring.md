# Boltup Java Spring App Starter

If you've already finished a java bootcamp, or you've used java in the enterprise, this should be relatively standard stuff.

This is a server side app.

It can be used to offer up REST APIs to a React or similar app. 

Or you can run it to serve up HTML/CSS/JS

don't forget to mention authorization service
