# Shared Infrastructue

You are being judged, that is _the entire purpose of a coding portfolio_.

Bringing a powerful back end with you, helping you display your skills, is the only practical strategy.

It has to be affordable, but Firebase is free at low volumes.

Documentation is voluminous, etc.

So either go with this, or pick something even better. But don't go naked. Bring a strong back end with you.

find the notes here about something like a ven diagram of:
  - cost
  - power
  - convenience/documentation

  and you want something that makes the cutoff in all 3

  i spent an hour looking for these notes did not find so probably best to just recreate
