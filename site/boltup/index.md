# Boltup

If PEG is a game for proving your skills with electives, then Boltup is the equivalent of a playing board. A canvas to paint your colors on, if painting was the analogy.

Please see [this](/membership) if there is any question about your qualification requirements.

What prevents success with a 10 app portfolio showing off skills with 20 or more electives? Usually we burn all our time budget on the app basics, which have little to do with the electives being demonstrated.

## Boltup is a Host Collection for Electives

#### Secured Infrastructure:

- Boltup Authentication
- Boltup BaaS

#### Secured App Starters

- Boltup Spring Boot
- Boltup Lit SPA
- Boltup React
- Boltup SSG

## Focus on the Demonstrating Electives

We want you to be able to build your Portfolio Electives based on decoupled standards.

Technology stacks used for Boltup is as decoupled or as standard as we can make it:

- Firebase for BaaS - Back End Infrastructure
- Web Components (Lit based) for SPA
- React because - well, it owns the market
- 11ty as the SSG

Boltup Infrastructure and Secured App Starters are designed to work as well as reasonably possible, with each other.
