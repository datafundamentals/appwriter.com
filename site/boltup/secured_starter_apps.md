# Boltup Starter Apps

To build a great portfolio with at least 10 different apps of various types showing takes a lot of work.

To play PEG, you want powerful starter apps that don't suck all your time proving you can build a starter app. Boltup starter apps are our solution to this need.

## Boltup Starter Apps

Each boltup starter app

- Is fully secured
- Converses easily with the back end (Firebase)
- Is ready to show your skill in adding elective features

## Types of Starter Apps

- Java Spring Boot
- Lit Web Components SPA
- React SPA
- SSG (Static Site Generator) 11ty PWA

## Are You Limited to These?

It should be substantially easier to even add your own starter app (python, php, etc).

The patterns and code used in these 4 boltup apps provided give you enough of a boost to create your own relatively easily, especially within the context of Boltup Authentication and some pretty good Firebase documentation, to be found online.

You are welcome to submit any such baseline starter app as a privately sourced boltup for the PEG community.
