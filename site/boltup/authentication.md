# Boltup Authentication

Boltup Authentication is written as a "universal" authentication service, in that it should work equally well on a client side app such as React or a Lit SPA, or a Server side app.

Authentication is provided by Firebase on the back end.

It can also be coupled with server side authorization service such as on a Java or Python server.

## Each Boltup Secured Starter App already consumes this widget.
