# Boltup Authentication for All Boltup Apps

Boltup Starter Apps are paired with Boltup Authentication for _portfolio grade_ application security.

#### Good Because

- It is good enough to provide secure connectivity with the back end.
- Works with any Boltup Starter App _**with a minimum of fuss.**_
- Google or ... handles the authentication - you don't.

#### Mediocre or "Portfolio Grade", Because

- You would write this differently if this were a production app.
- Sacrifices coding elegance for _**something that drops in easily**_.
- May force you to write a minimal amount of unconventional javascript on your app.

## Purpose

- Allows you to use [Firebase on the back end](/boltup/BaaS/) for a dozen or more excellent back end services.
- Professional login feel for your portfolio apps.
- Your users don't have to create a username & password! Deal killer, for casual visitors!

## Features

- Securely authenticates users
- Drops in quickly on any [Boltup Starter App](/boltup/starter_apps/)
- Can also be used on any other app with an html UI with varying degrees of success.
- Can also be paired with server side _**authorization service**_ such as on a [Java](/boltup/spring/) or Python server.

## Each Boltup Secured Starter App already consumes this widget.

- [Boltup Java Spring-Web](/boltup/spring)
- [Boltup Lit SPA](/boltup/lit_spa)
- [Boltup React SPA](/boltup/react)
- [Boltup 11ty SSG PWA](/boltup/11ty_SSG)
